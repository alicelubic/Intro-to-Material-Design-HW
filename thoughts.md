ntro to Material Design Homework - Responses


##### Write at least 5 things that you like or dislike about the [Android Developers](https://developer.android.com/index.html) website design.

1. I've actually been thinking about this a lot lately... how websites are now designed to be compatible with mobile devices, or how Netflix has that style which makes it weird and hard to use anything without a touch screen... I get that for the Android Developers site it makes sense to have it set up that way since their whole schtick with material design is to have consistency, but it's still hard to get used to. 

2. OK actually I decided that I don't like how the website is the same as it would be on a mobile device -- the way the entire screen moves when you scroll up at the top or down at the bottom -- I hate that.

3. I like the drawer menu and the tabs at the top -- it makes it very easy and clear what content is on the site and how to navegate to it.

4. I like the material design element of having animations for the buttons that make it seem like the button is rising to meet your cursor - it succeeds in making it feel like a more interactive experience.

5. I like how the search view extends when there is room so that it takes up the whole tool bar. Again, it makes it an interactive experience.

6. I like how there are lots of buttons for "more" or the equivalent, essentially showing you the minimum amount of information to keep it clean and neat, and then making it easy to expand on any of that without needing to navigate away from the area you are in.

7. I also like when you close the drawer, the view expands to take up the extra space, but it doesnt just stretch, it rearranges the items to use the space more wisely. That's cool.

8. After using their website to do this homework, I'm confused as to why it is so unsettling for me to have the style and layout be the same as it would be on phones or tablets -- I would 100% rather it be like a normal website when you're on a computer, and save the cool stuff for the mobile devices. I get that that misses the whole point. But I really don't like viewing it on the computer.

##### Write at least 3 reasons why the [Android Developers](https://developer.android.com/index.html) website design follows Material Design guidelines. Be as specific as possible.

1. Within the design section, the links to animation, style, etc. are on some sort of cardview that has elevation to show shadow.

2. When you hover over the developer console icon on the top right, it gives the allusion that it is raising up to meet the cursor.

3. It uses animations like having the drawer come out from the left, or like within the DEVELOP page, the visible screen is like one of those extended toolbars and then there is a floating down arrow button to take you to the actual content.
